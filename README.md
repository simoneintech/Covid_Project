# Covid-19 Project

In this repository I have completed a project on COVID-19 <br />
from the years of 2019-2021. I wanted to understand how COVID-19 <br />
have effected the world globally. 

<b> How I Started </b><br />
Firstl, I got my dataset from <a href="data.gov">Data.gov</a>. Downloaded 
this data as a CSV file to do some data cleaning over in Excel. 

<br />
In excel I anazlyzed my data, wanted to see what information was provdied. <br />
Got myself familiar with the dataset and went into cleaning my data. 

I cleaned up some of the columns with the information I needed for SQL.
I then created two different worksheets for Vaccinations and one
for Deaths. <br />
With this I would be able to analyze my data more clearly in SQL using two
tables to further help with my analysis.
